> A requiem for the unrecovered.

Photic is a flight-proven toolbox for building high-power rocket flight computer
software. It was created in the interest of bringing power and elegance
to what is an oft-overlooked aspect of high-power rocket development.

This library conforms to the Arduino library specification, but is abstract
enough that it can fit into any platform.

**Photic is currently in an alpha state as we prepare it for first flight in
Spaceport America Cup 2020.**
